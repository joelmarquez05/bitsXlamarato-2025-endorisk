# This folder contains trained models and their metadata.
# Naming convention: {model_type}_{version}.joblib
# Example: xgboost_v1.joblib, xgboost_v1_metadata.joblib
#
# IMPORTANT: Also save preprocessing artifacts here (scalers, encoders)
# so the Streamlit app can load everything needed for inference.
